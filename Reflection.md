# Reflection — Assignment B

> 2–5 sentences per Part unless noted otherwise. Focus on **who is impacted** by each policy and **why** the data-structure logic leads to that outcome. You may cite items from the Works Cited in the README.

Start Here:

## Part 1 — LIFO (Last Hired, First Fired)
- Based on your LIFO run, who is most likely to be laid off first?  
- What historical or social patterns might this mirror (e.g., recent hires, junior roles, cohorts from DEI or international programs)?  
- In 2–5 sentences, explain how a stack’s “last in, first out” mechanic embodies the policy and its downstream impacts.

## Part 2 — FIFO (First Hired, First Fired)
- Based on your FIFO run, who is most likely to be laid off first?  
- What values does this policy appear to prioritize (e.g., early retirement incentives, budget relief from long-tenured cost)?  
- In 2–5 sentences, discuss whether this is “fair,” to whom, and what trade-offs it creates (skills loss, loyalty, age impacts, etc.).

## Part 3 — Priority Queue (Lower Performance, Higher Cost)
- Briefly describe your scoring approach in `computePerformanceScore`: which signals you used and how you handled missing/unsafe values.  
- In 3–5 sentences, reflect on **bias and trade-offs** in this policy:
  - Reviews/OKRs can encode bias (gender, team visibility, attribution).  
  - Cost metrics can penalize sponsored, disabled, or senior employees.  
  - There are **no tie-breakers in code**; if two people tie, the heap may return either. If you were to choose tie-breakers, what ethical risks would they introduce?
